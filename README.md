# UK-Public-Transport-Unemployment-Code-Repository-Python-
UK Public Transport &amp; Unemployment Code Repository [Python] - Stores the code for my final year project, investigating the relation between public transport and unemployment using census data.


For Final Report, see Unemployment and Public Transport Final Report.pdf


Brief Update: Unfortunately, Google have changed the way their APIs work for mapping. It is no longer possible to have free usage unregistered capped accounts, as this project relied on, and I am not prepared to register a credit card to keep the API keys active for a number of reasons. Foremost amongst these are that even though it is technically possible at the time of writing to have an account limited to only "free but we need your credit card" tier- I don't trust Google not to change this on a whim.

If you are interested in getting this to work, you would need to replace the API keys with ones you have registered to an account with associated payment method. As far as I am aware, the syntax should still work although I have not tested this for obvious reasons.
